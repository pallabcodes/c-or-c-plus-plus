# Extensibility Standards

## Scope
Applies to all extensibility code including plugin architecture, APIs, and extension points. Extends repository root rules.

## Plugin Architecture

### Extension Points
* Define extension points
* Extension registration
* Extension lifecycle management
* Extension dependencies

### Plugin API Design
* Stable API surface
* Versioned APIs
* Backward compatibility
* Deprecation strategy

### Extension Discovery
* Extension manifest parsing
* Extension metadata
* Extension capabilities
* Extension marketplace integration

## Extension Lifecycle

### Extension Loading
* Dynamic library loading
* Extension initialization
* Extension activation
* Lazy loading support

### Extension Execution
* Sandboxed execution where possible
* Extension context isolation
* Resource access control
* Error isolation

### Extension Management
* Enable and disable extensions
* Extension configuration
* Extension updates
* Extension uninstallation

## Extension Communication

### Event System
* Publish subscribe pattern
* Extension event hooks
* Editor event notifications
* File system event propagation

### Command System
* Extension command registration
* Command execution
* Command palette integration
* Keyboard shortcut binding

### API Services
* Service registration and lookup
* Dependency injection
* Service lifecycle
* Interface versioning

## Implementation Requirements
* Secure extension execution
* Efficient extension loading
* Proper resource management
* Error handling and recovery
* Extension versioning
* API documentation

## Performance Considerations
* Lazy extension loading
* Minimize extension overhead
* Efficient event distribution
* Resource pooling
* Async extension operations

## Integration Points
* Core IDE integration
* Editor component integration
* UI framework integration
* Configuration system integration

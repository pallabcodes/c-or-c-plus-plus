# Networking and OS Tuning

## Socket and Kernel
* TCP_NODELAY, SO_REUSEPORT, keepalive tuning
* somaxconn, backlog, port range, rcv snd buffers

## Limits and NUMA
* rlimits for fds; pinning and memory locality

## IO Characteristics
* Understand NIC offloads and their effect on latency

## Testing
* Validate tuning via load; watch drops, retransmits, and latency tails

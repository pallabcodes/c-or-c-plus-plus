# Performance Optimization

## Batching
* Batch event processing and writes to reduce syscalls

## Data Structures
* Cache friendly queues and timer wheels; avoid pointer chasing

## Copy Avoidance
* Zero copy buffers; scatter gather writes

## Profiling
* Periodic profiles; guardrails to prevent regressions

## Targets
* Publish latency budgets per scenario documented in README

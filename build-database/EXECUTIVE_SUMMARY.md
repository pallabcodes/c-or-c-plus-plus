   - Adaptive Execution (operator fusion, vectorized processing)

2. **Storage Engine**
   - B+ Tree (ACID-optimized for OLTP)
   - LSM Tree (write-optimized for analytics)
   - Hybrid Engine (intelligent workload adaptation)
   - Page Management (buffer pool, WAL, recovery)

3. **Advanced Features**
   - **Vector Search**: HNSW + IVF + PQ (10-100x faster ANN)
   - **Time-Series**: Gorilla compression + adaptive chunking
   - **Graph Database**: Property graphs + algorithms
   - **AI/ML**: Native machine learning optimizations

4. **Distributed Systems**
   - Raft Consensus (leader election, log replication)
   - Multi-Paxos (high-performance consensus)
   - CRDTs (conflict-free replicated data types)
   - Saga Pattern (distributed transactions)

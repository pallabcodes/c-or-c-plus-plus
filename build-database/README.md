Great — designing and implementing a **database in C or C++** requires deep systems knowledge. Just like with compilers, I’ll give you a structured **ascending order (prerequisites → advanced)** list of topics you must learn.

---

# 🗂 1. Foundations

Before touching DB internals, you must be solid in:

* **C / C++ systems programming**

  * Memory management (malloc/free, new/delete)
  * Pointers, structs, classes
  * File I/O (binary and text)
  * Templates (if C++)
* **Data structures**

  * Linked lists, hash tables, dynamic arrays
  * Trees (binary, B-trees, AVL, red-black)
  * Heaps / priority queues
* **Computer architecture**

  * Caches, CPU–memory interaction
  * Disk vs RAM latency
  * Endianness, alignment, paging basics
* **Operating systems basics**

  * File descriptors, system calls
  * Memory-mapped files
  * Process scheduling
  * Concurrency primitives (mutex, semaphores, condition variables)

---

# 🗂 2. Theory Prerequisites

* **Database theory**

  * Relational model
  * Transactions (ACID)
  * SQL basics
* **Indexing theory**

  * B-trees, B+ trees
  * Hash indexes
* **Concurrency control**

  * 2PL (Two-phase locking)
  * MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
* **Storage models**

  * Row-oriented vs column-oriented databases
  * Log-structured merge trees (LSM)

---

# 🗂 3. Database Architecture (Phases / Components)

Here are the major parts you’ll eventually implement (ordered as you’d build them):

1. **Storage Manager**

   * Page layout (fixed-size pages, metadata)
   * Slotted pages (record storage with variable-length rows)
   * Memory-mapped file I/O
   * Write-ahead log (WAL)

2. **Index Manager**

   * Implement B+ tree or hash index
   * Secondary indexes
   * Range queries

3. **Query Processor**

   * Parsing SQL (can reuse compiler parsing skills: tokens → AST)
   * Query planner (logical plan: select → project → join)
   * Query optimizer (rule-based → cost-based)
   * Query execution engine (iterators / volcano model)

4. **Transaction Manager**

   * Lock manager (shared/exclusive locks)
   * Deadlock detection/prevention
   * MVCC implementation
   * Isolation levels (READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE)

5. **Recovery System**

   * Write-ahead logging
   * Checkpointing
   * Crash recovery (redo/undo logging, ARIES algorithm)

---

# 🗂 4. Advanced Topics

* **Distributed databases**

  * Sharding, replication
  * CAP theorem, consensus (Raft, Paxos)
* **Columnar storage & compression**
* **Vectorized query execution**
* **Cost-based optimization** (statistics, histograms)
* **Parallel execution** (multi-core, SIMD)
* **JIT query compilation** (LLVM integration)

---

# 🗂 5. Practical Skills / Tools

* **File handling** → raw binary storage, memory-mapped files
* **Concurrency libraries** → pthreads, C++11 std::thread
* **Testing** → property-based testing (QuickCheck-style)
* **Benchmarking** → TPC-H, YCSB
* **Git / CMake** → large project organization

# 🚀 Suggested Learning Order (Toy DB Roadmap)

1. C/C++ systems programming + OS + architecture
2. Learn relational model + ACID + SQL basics
3. File storage engine (page manager, record manager)
4. Implement an index (start with B+ tree)
5. Write a simple SQL parser → AST
6. Build a basic query executor (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN with nested loops)
7. Add a transaction manager (locks, rollback)
8. Add write-ahead logging + recovery
9. Add query optimizer (pushdown filters, join reordering)
10. Experiment with advanced features (MVCC, column store, distributed replication)

👉 Do you want me to create a **parallel roadmap like I did for compilers** (e.g., “week 1: implement a page manager, week 2: add a record manager …”) so you can actually build a **toy database in C/C++** step by step?

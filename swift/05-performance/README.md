## Learning Path

1. Start with `01_memory_management.swift` for memory optimization
2. Progress through `02_cpu_performance.swift` for CPU optimization
3. Study `03_ui_performance.swift` for UI optimization
4. Master `04_network_performance.swift` for network optimization
5. Complete `05_profiling_tools.swift` for performance monitoring

## Best Practices

- **Measure First**: Always profile before optimizing
- **Optimize Hot Paths**: Focus on performance-critical code
- **Use Appropriate Tools**: Choose the right tool for the job
- **Test Performance**: Validate optimizations with benchmarks
- **Monitor in Production**: Track performance metrics in real apps

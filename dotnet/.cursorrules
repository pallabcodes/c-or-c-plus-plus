Dotnet standards and conventions

Scope
* Applies to all C sharp and F sharp code in dotnet directory
* Extends repository root rules

Language and runtime
* Target modern dotnet runtime as defined by project files
* Use nullable reference types and respect warnings
* Use UTF eight encoding without byte order mark and use LF line endings

Naming and structure
* Use PascalCase for public types and members
* Use camelCase for locals and parameters
* Keep files focused and cohesive with single primary type per file when reasonable

Async and concurrency
* Use async await for I O bound work
* Use Task dot Run only for CPU bound work
* Always pass CancellationToken through async call chains
* Use ConfigureAwait false in library code that is not application entry
* Avoid blocking waits and avoid deadlocks by staying async all the way

Exceptions and errors
* Throw the most specific exception type
* Do not swallow exceptions without actionable handling
* Wrap external boundary failures with context preserving inner exceptions

Resource management
* Implement IDisposable when owning unmanaged or scarce resources
* Prefer await using for IAsyncDisposable where supported
* Ensure deterministic disposal paths

Collections and threading
* Prefer immutable collections for shared data
* Use concurrent collections for shared mutable data
* Avoid locks where higher level primitives exist

Logging and metrics
* Use structured logging with context
* Avoid logging sensitive data
* Emit metrics for critical paths when relevant

Reviews and quality
* Expect line by line review from senior engineers
* Document non obvious design choices in code comments near usage
* Keep public surface documented with XML documentation comments

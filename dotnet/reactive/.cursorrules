Reactive programming standards

Scope
* Applies to reactive programming examples and modules
* Extends dotnet rules

Observables and subscriptions
* Dispose every subscription deterministically
* Prefer Observable dot Create only when necessary and ensure correct OnNext OnError OnCompleted contracts
* Use Publish and RefCount for hot sharing when appropriate

Backpressure and flow control
* Use Buffer Window Sample Throttle or Debounce to control flow
* Use rate limiting or bounded buffers when bridging to imperative consumers

Error handling
* Use Retry Catch and Timeout appropriately
* Do not swallow errors without routing to logging or fallback

Scheduling
* Be explicit about schedulers when crossing threads
* Avoid unnecessary context switches

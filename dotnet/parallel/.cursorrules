Parallel and concurrency standards

Scope
* Applies to parallel programming examples and modules
* Extends dotnet rules

Concurrency safety
* All long running or cancellable operations accept CancellationToken
* Use bounded queues or backpressure for producer consumer pipelines
* Prefer concurrent collections over manual locks
* Avoid blocking waits on async code

Performance and throughput
* Measure throughput and latency where relevant
* Avoid excessive allocations in tight loops
* Prefer data locality and cache friendly structures

Reliability
* Handle OperationCanceledException explicitly
* Use retry and circuit breaker patterns where external dependencies exist
* Ensure graceful shutdown that drains queues where applicable

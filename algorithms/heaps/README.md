### **Additional Tips to Prepare:**
1. **Learn the Concepts**: Focus on understanding the **underlying math concepts** behind these algorithms. You don’t need to dive deep into textbooks, but getting familiar with these core concepts will make it much easier to solve problems during interviews.

2. **Solve a Variety of Problems**: While the list above covers the core concepts, try to solve problems of varying difficulty on platforms like LeetCode, CodeForces, or HackerRank. This will help you get comfortable with both easy and advanced variations of the problems.

3. **Practice Time Complexity**: For each algorithm, be aware of its **time complexity** and when to apply it to ensure optimal performance (especially for large input sizes).

4. **Don’t Just Memorize Code**: Make sure to **understand the intuition** behind each algorithm. Knowing when to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes, Euclid’s algorithm for GCD, or modular arithmetic can help you solve problems more efficiently and apply these concepts in different contexts.

### **Conclusion**
By focusing on these **core math problems** and practicing them consistently, you'll build a solid math foundation tailored for coding interviews. You'll be ready to face interviews in **product-based companies** with confidence in your mathematical problem-solving abilities, without feeling unprepared or overwhelmed by complex math topics!

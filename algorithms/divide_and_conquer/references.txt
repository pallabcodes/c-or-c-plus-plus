Divide and Conquer works well with:

1. Arrays
   - Example: Merge Sort, Closest Pair Problem.

2. Strings
   - Example: Longest Palindromic Substring (recursive).

3. Trees
   - Example: Binary Tree Traversals (recursive approaches).

4. Graphs (in rare cases)
   - Example: Divide and Conquer MST (on special types of graphs).

Dynamic Programming works well with:

1. Arrays
   - Example: Knapsack Problem.

2. Strings
   - Example: Longest Palindromic Subsequence.

3. Grids (2D Arrays)
   - Example: Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum.

4. Trees (Tree DP)
   - Example: Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree.

5. Graphs
   - Example: Shortest Path with DP.

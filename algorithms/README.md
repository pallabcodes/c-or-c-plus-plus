You're absolutely right! While I had initially organized the **graph algorithms** specifically under the graph category, it's important to apply the same thinking to other data structures where relevant. Certain **algorithms/patterns** work efficiently with specific data structures like **arrays, heaps, stacks**, etc., and it's helpful to mention those as well.

Let's go ahead and **organize the algorithms** under their **relevant data structures** as I did for **graph algorithms**.

### **Updated Structure with Relevant Data Structures for Algorithms**

#### **1. Arrays and Strings**
Many algorithms work directly on **arrays and strings**, so let's group the applicable algorithms here.

##### **Algorithms:**
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms:**
  - Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, etc.
  - **Problems:**
    - Kth Smallest Element in an Array (Quickselect)
    - Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Binary Search)
  
- **Sliding Window** (works on Arrays, Strings, and Deques)
  - Maximum Subarray Sum (K elements)
  - Minimum Window Substring

- **Two Pointers** (commonly used with Arrays and Strings)
  - Pair with Target Sum
  - Trapping Rainwater

- **Greedy Algorithms** (works on Arrays, Lists)
  - Activity Selection Problem
  - Job Scheduling

#### **2. Heaps (Priority Queues)**
Heaps are great for **efficient priority queue management** and often used in algorithms like **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, **K-th Largest/Smallest**, and **Median Maintenance**.

##### **Algorithms:**
- **Heap Algorithms:**
  - Merge K Sorted Lists
  - Kth Largest Element in an Array
  - Median of a Stream

- **Greedy Algorithms** (works with Heaps):
  - Huffman Coding
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm

#### **3. Stacks and Queues**
These data structures are fundamental for algorithms that involve **depth-first search (DFS)**, **breadth-first search (BFS)**, or **expression parsing**.

##### **Algorithms:**
- **Stack-based Algorithms:**
  - Valid Parentheses
  - Daily Temperature Problem
  - Reverse Polish Notation Evaluation

- **Queue-based Algorithms:**
  - Sliding Window Maximum (using Deque)
  - BFS in Graphs (for level-wise traversal)

- **Backtracking** (commonly uses stacks to track recursion state)
  - N-Queens Problem
  - Subset Sum Problem

#### **4. Dynamic Programming (DP)**
Dynamic Programming can be applied in many cases, but it's often used in combination with **Arrays** and **Lists** to solve optimization problems like **Knapsack**, **Longest Increasing Subsequence**, **Edit Distance**, etc.

##### **Algorithms:**
- **Dynamic Programming Problems:**
  - Knapsack Problem (1D/2D DP)
  - Longest Palindromic Subsequence
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence
  - Decode Ways
  - Coin Change Problem

#### **5. Trees**
**Tree-based algorithms** often work with **binary trees**, **binary search trees (BSTs)**, **tries**, and **segment trees**. Many classical problems like **lowest common ancestor (LCA)**, **tree traversals**, and **balanced trees** come into play here.

##### **Algorithms:**
- **Tree Traversals:**
  - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder DFS
  - Level Order Traversal (BFS)

- **Binary Search Trees (BST):**
  - Valid BST
  - Kth Smallest Element in BST
  - Lowest Common Ancestor in BST

- **Backtracking on Trees:**
  - N-Queens on an NxN grid (Backtracking on trees)
  - Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

---

#### **6. Graphs**
Graphs are often used for **network flow**, **shortest path** problems, **topological sorting**, and **graph traversal** algorithms.

##### **Algorithms:**
- **Graph Algorithms:**
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Single Source Shortest Path)
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - Kruskal’s and Prim’s Algorithms (MST)

- **Topological Sorting** (works with Directed Acyclic Graphs, or DAGs):
  - Topological Sort (DFS)
  - Course Schedule Problem (Cycle Detection)

- **Union Find / Disjoint Set**:
  - Find the Connected Components in a Graph
  - Cycle Detection in Undirected Graphs

---

### **Summary:**
I've now grouped the **algorithms and patterns** based on **their related data structures** where applicable. This should help in understanding how different **algorithms** rely on and utilize various **data structures**. 

For instance:
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, etc.
- **Arrays/Strings**: Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Sorting, Searching, etc.
- **Heaps**: Kth Largest Element, Median of Stream, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, etc.
- **Stacks/Queues**: BFS, DFS, Sliding Window Maximum, Expression Evaluation, etc.

This organization will not only help you in cracking algorithm-based questions but also sharpen your understanding of which **data structures** are most efficient for solving specific types of problems.

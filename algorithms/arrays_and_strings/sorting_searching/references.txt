Sorting and Searching algorithms work well with:

1. Arrays
   - Example: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.

2. Strings (as arrays of characters)
   - Example: Searching for substrings using binary search.

3. Trees (for specialized searches like binary search tree).

4. Heaps (for heap sort and priority-based searching).

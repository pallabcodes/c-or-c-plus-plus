Awesome — let’s chart an **ascending-order knowledge map** and a **practical build roadmap** for a **production-grade MQTT broker** (think: Mosquitto/EMQX-class minimal core) in **C/C++**. We’ll target **MQTT 3.1.1 + MQTT 5.0**, QoS 0/1/2, TLS, persistence, and **clustered scaling** with shared subscriptions.

---

# 1) Ascending order: topics you must know

## A. Systems & networking (foundation)

1. C/C++ systems programming (RAII, atomics, lock-free queues, ring buffers)
2. TCP/IP fundamentals: congestion, Nagle/Delayed ACKs, keepalive, half-close
3. Evented I/O: `epoll`/`kqueue`/IOCP; edge vs level triggered; backpressure
4. TLS/mTLS (OpenSSL/BoringSSL/wolfSSL): cert chains, session resumption, ALPN
5. Memory & perf: cache lines, NUMA basics, zero-copy, scatter/gather I/O
6. OS tuning: file descriptors, rlimits, TCP buffers, `SO_REUSEPORT`, `TCP_NODELAY`

## B. MQTT protocol (spec mastery)

7. MQTT packet formats (fixed header, remaining length varint, properties v5)
8. Session model: Clean Start/Session Present (3.1.1 cleanSession); keep-alive pings
9. **QoS semantics**:

   * QoS 0 (at most once)
   * QoS 1 (PUBACK)
   * QoS 2 (exactly once: PUBREC → PUBREL → PUBCOMP state machine)
10. Subscriptions: topic filters, wildcards (`+`, `#`), shared subs (`$share/<group>/...`)
11. Retained messages & Will message semantics
12. v5 features: Reason Codes, User Properties, Flow Control (Receive Maximum), Topic Aliases, Session Expiry, Server Keep Alive, Request/Response, Subscription Identifiers
13. Error handling: malformed packets, protocol violations, throttling/ban policies

## C. Broker internals

14. Connection acceptor & multiplexer (reactor pattern)
15. Parser/encoder (zero-copy, bounded allocations)
16. **Routing core**: topic trie / radix tree with wildcard matching + shared sub dispatch
17. **Session store**: in-memory state + durable persistence (messages inflight, subscriptions, props)
18. **Retained store** (per topic)
19. **QoS pipeline**: inflight windows, dedup, retransmit, retry timers, expiry
20. **Persistence**: WAL/append log + snapshot, or embed RocksDB/LMDB
21. **Backpressure** end-to-end: socket write-blocking → per-client send queues → flow limits
22. Rate limiting & quota (per client/tenant/topic)

## D. Cluster & scale-out

23. Horizontal scale: topic-space partitioning or consistent hashing of client IDs
24. **Shared subscriptions** correctness in cluster (work sharing)
25. Session replication: primary/replica or consensus (Raft) for durable sessions
26. Retained/Subscription catalogs replicated & consistent
27. Inter-broker transport: gRPC/TCP, framing, exactly-once handoff semantics
28. Bridge support to other brokers (MQTT-to-MQTT)

## E. Ops, security, and ecosystem

29. AuthN/AuthZ: username/password, JWT/OIDC, x509, ACL engine (topic filter rules)
30. Multi-tenancy: virtual hosts/namespaces; per-tenant limits & isolation
31. Observability: Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing/logging; `$SYS` topics
32. Config management: hot reload, dynamic listeners, SIGHUP safety
33. HA/Upgrades: graceful drain, connection migration, rolling restarts, compat tests
34. Protocol bridges: WebSocket, MQTT over WebSocket; optional: QUIC/HTTP/3
35. Benchmarking & correctness: interop (Paho/Mosquitto), soak, chaos (packet loss/latency)

# 2) Production build roadmap (lean but real)

### Phase 0 — Skeleton & decisions (1–2 weeks)

* Pick libs: **io\_uring/`epoll`**, **OpenSSL**, **RocksDB** (or LMDB) for persistence.
* Code layout: `net/`, `proto/`, `broker/`, `store/`, `cluster/`, `auth/`, `obs/`.
* CI with ASAN/TSAN; fuzz packet parser (AFL/libFuzzer).
  **Deliverable:** server boots, health & metrics endpoints, config loader.

---

### Phase 1 — Single-node MQTT 3.1.1 (2–3 weeks)

* Accept TCP + TLS; parse CONNECT; manage keepalive/PINGREQ/RESP.
* Implement SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE with wildcard topic trie.
* Publish pipeline: QoS 0/1/2 including retransmit on timeout; retained & will messages.
* Session store in memory; persistent retained messages to RocksDB; basic ACL (allow-all).
* `$SYS/#` topics for basic stats.
  **Tests:** interop with Eclipse Paho clients; packet fuzz; abrupt disconnect recovery.
  **Deliverable:** stable single-node broker (TLS, QoS 0/1/2, retained/will).

---

### Phase 2 — MQTT 5.0 features (2–3 weeks)

* Properties: Reason Codes, User Properties, Session Expiry, Server Keep Alive.
* Flow control: Receive Maximum, Topic Aliases; per-client inflight window.
* Subscription Identifiers; shared subscriptions (`$share`).
  **Tests:** conformance matrix against Paho v5; mixed 3.1.1 + 5.0 clients.

---

### Phase 3 — Persistence & crash safety (2 weeks)

* Durable **session persistence** (subscriptions, inflight QoS1/2, expiry timers).
* Append-only WAL for publishes + periodic snapshot.
* Crash recovery: rebuild session & retained stores; dedup inflight.
  **Deliverable:** survives power-cut tests with no message loss beyond guarantees.

---

### Phase 4 — Performance pass (1–2 weeks)

* Event loop batching; scatter/gather writes; coalesced acks.
* Zero-copy encode where possible; pool buffers; small object allocator.
* N `accept()` sharding with `SO_REUSEPORT`; CPU pinning; per-core reactors.
* Backpressure: bounded send queues, watermarks; drop/slow-path policies by QoS.
  **Bench:** measure p50/95/99 latency & throughput; target 1M idle conns + sustainable msgs/s.

---

### Phase 5 — Clustering v1 (2–3 weeks)

* **Sharding model:** hash(clientId) or hash(topic) → partition; each node owns a set.
* **Inter-broker bus:** gRPC/TCP with length-prefixed frames; ensure idempotent forwards.
* **Session placement:** sticky to home shard; reconnect migration on node failure.
* **Shared subscriptions across nodes**: fair work distribution; at-least-once delivery.
* **Replicate retained store** (async) + periodic consistency checks.
  **Deliverable:** N-node cluster with horizontal scale; single writer per session.

---

### Phase 6 — HA & session replication (2–3 weeks)

* Add **Raft** (or another consensus) per shard for **durable session state** and retained catalog.
* Fast-path publishes remain at-least-once; QoS2 exactly-once preserved via per-session inflight replication.
* Leadership transfer, snapshotting, catch-up install.
  **Tests:** node kill, network partitions, rolling restarts; ensure no duplicate QoS2 completes.

---

### Phase 7 — Security, authz, and tenancy (1–2 weeks)

* mTLS between brokers and for clients (optional), JWT/OIDC; password backends.
* **ACL engine**: allow/deny rules on topic filters, QoS caps, retained permissions.
* Tenants/namespaces with resource quotas (conns, inflight, msg/s, bytes/s).
  **Deliverable:** secure multi-tenant cluster; dynamic ACL reload.

---

### Phase 8 — Ops polish & ecosystem (ongoing)

* `$SYS` hierarchy complete (connections, inflight, drops, heap, CPU, shards).
* Prometheus metrics, exemplar traces (OpenTelemetry), structured JSON logs.
* WebSocket listener; optional QUIC/HTTP/3.
* Backups: snapshot retained & session raft-state; disaster-recovery drill.
* Bridges to Kafka/NATS or MQTT-to-MQTT for edge aggregation.

---

## Minimal external surfaces

### Listener config

* TCP+TLS, WS(S), listener groups, per-listener limits; optional PROXY protocol.

### AuthN/Z

* `PLAIN`, `SCRAM`, JWT, x509 (CN/SAN → principal); ACL DSL:
  `allow client('mobile-*') publish 'telemetry/+/data' qos <= 1`

### Admin API

* Nodes, shards, leader transfer, drain, stats, ACL reload, tenant CRUD, snapshot/restore.

---

## Correctness & reliability checklist

* **QoS2 state machine** exactness (no dup deliver/complete).
* **Session expiry** and Will publish semantics under all disconnect reasons.
* **Flow control** respected (Receive Maximum; no buffer bloat).
* **Backpressure** prevents broker OOM; slow consumer handling.
* **Cluster**: single session owner, idempotent forwards, consistent retained catalog.
* **Crash safety**: WAL replay + snapshot works; inflight dedup on restart.

---

## Benchmarking & tests

* Interop: Paho (C/C++/Java/Python), Mosquitto clients; 3.1.1 + 5.0.
* Load: many small QoS1 publishes (telemetry), fewer QoS2; measure tail lat.
* Soak: 24–72h runs with churn, random disconnects, TLS renegotiation.
* Chaos: packet loss/latency, broker kill -9, disk full/slow, cert rotation, clock skew.
* Fuzz: all control packets; malformed Remaining Length; invalid properties.

---

## A realistic 12–16 week sequence

1. Core server + TLS + parser + keepalive (3.1.1)
2. SUB/PUB QoS0/1/2 + retained + will; `$SYS` basic
3. MQTT 5.0 properties & flow control
4. Durable session + retained persistence; crash recovery
5. Perf pass: event loop, zero-copy, backpressure
6. Cluster sharding + shared subs across nodes
7. Session replication via Raft; leader transfer; snapshots
8. AuthN/Z + tenants; WebSocket; full observability; bridges & ops polish

---

## Tech choices (C/C++)

* **I/O:** `epoll` (Linux) or `io_uring` (later); per-core reactor.
* **TLS:** OpenSSL/BoringSSL.
* **Persistence:** RocksDB (fast, simple) or LMDB; WAL + snapshot.
* **Cluster RPC:** gRPC or custom framed TCP.
* **Metrics/Tracing:** Prometheus C++ client; OpenTelemetry C++.
* **Build:** CMake; clang-tidy; sanitizers; libFuzzer.

---

If you want, I can sketch:

* the **packet parser/encoder structs**,
* the **topic trie data structure** (wildcards + shared-sub dispatch), or
* a **protobuf schema** for inter-broker replication.

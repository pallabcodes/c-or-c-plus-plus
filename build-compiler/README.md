# Distributive minimal production-grade database

Awesome. Let‚Äôs plan a **production-grade, minimal distributed database** you can actually ship. We‚Äôll do two things:

1. an **ascending-order knowledge map** (prereqs ‚Üí advanced), and
2. a **practical build roadmap** (components, milestones, tests).

I‚Äôll assume **C/C++**. To keep it ‚Äúminimal but production-grade,‚Äù we‚Äôll target a **linearizable replicated key‚Äìvalue store** with a simple query layer. (You can bolt on SQL later.) Think: **RocksDB-backed KV + Raft + gRPC + observability**.

---

# 1) Ascending order: topics you must know

## A. Systems & single-node storage (foundation)

1. C/C++ systems programming (resource ownership, RAII, threads, atomics)
2. Filesystems & I/O (page cache, O\_DIRECT basics, fsync/durable writes)
3. Storage engines (WAL, memtable, SSTables, compaction; B+Tree vs LSM)
4. Caches & memory (NUMA basics, cache lines, false sharing)
5. Concurrency primitives (mutex, rwlock, condvars, lock-free queues)

## B. Networking & RPC

6. TCP, timeouts, backoff, connection pooling, keepalive
7. RPC frameworks (gRPC/Protobuf or Cap‚Äôn Proto), streaming vs unary
8. Load balancing patterns (client-side, DNS, xDS overview)

## C. Distributed systems core

9. Failure models & clocks (crash vs byzantine, monotonic vs wall clock)
10. CAP & consistency models (linearizability, sequential consistency, SI)
11. Majority quorums & replication (WAL shipping vs state machine replication)
12. **Consensus** (Raft or Multi-Paxos): leader election, log replication, snapshots, membership changes (joint consensus)
13. Replicated state machine design (command serialization, idempotence)

## D. Database semantics

14. KV API design (GET/PUT/DELETE, compare-and-set, range scans)
15. Transactions (start with **no multi-key tx**; then add snapshot reads; optional: per-shard transactions)
16. Read semantics (leader reads, lease/ReadIndex for linearizable reads; follower reads with read-repair)
17. Compaction & snapshots (LSM compaction; Raft snapshotting & log compaction interplay)

## E. Cluster management & ops

18. Membership & discovery (static config ‚Üí gossip/coord service)
19. Rebalancing & partitioning (consistent hashing; shard maps)
20. Observability (metrics, tracing, structured logs, profiling)
21. Backups, restore, disaster recovery (incremental, point-in-time with RAFT index)
22. Security & multi-tenancy (TLS mTLS, authn/z, quotas, rate limits)
23. Upgrades/rollouts (binary compatibility, rolling restarts, data migration)
24. Benchmarking & correctness (YCSB, Jepsen-style tests; chaos engineering)

# 2) Build roadmap (minimal production KV DB)

### Phase 0 ‚Äî Decisions & skeleton (1‚Äì2 weeks)

* **Decide scope**: linearizable KV (no cross-key tx), single region, N=3 or 5 nodes.
* **Pick stack**:

  * **Storage**: use **RocksDB** (C++) to stay focused on distribution (or write a tiny LSM if you insist).
  * **Consensus**: implement **Raft** (or embed an existing Raft lib if allowed).
  * **RPC**: **gRPC** + **Protobuf**.
  * **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces/logs.
  * **Build/CI**: CMake, sanitizers, ASAN/TSAN, fuzzers.
* **Deliverable**: repo with modules, proto files, CI, a no-op server exposing health & metrics.

---

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Single-node durable KV (2‚Äì3 weeks)

* **WAL + storage**: integrate RocksDB; expose `Put/Get/Delete`, prefix/range iteration.
* **Write path**: synchronous commit (fsync) and batched writes.
* **Backpressure**: basic write throttling if compaction lags.
* **Deliverable**: single node daemon; CLI client can set/get; survives crash.
* **Tests**: crash-recovery tests, fsync toggles, durability under power-cut simulation.

---

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Raft replication (3‚Äì4 weeks)

* **Implement Raft**:

  * Leader election with randomized timeouts.
  * Log replication, commit index, apply loop (replicated state machine).
  * Snapshots: periodic state snapshot to trim the log.
  * **Joint consensus** for safe membership change (add/remove node).
* **Linearizable reads**:

  * Start with **leader-only reads**.
  * Then add **ReadIndex/lease reads** (Raft barrier) to avoid log writes on reads.
* **Deliverable**: 3-node cluster, automatic leader election, linearizable GET/PUT.
* **Tests**: leader failover, network partitions, slow follower, snapshot install.

---

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Sharding/partitioning (2‚Äì3 weeks)

* **Shard map**: consistent hashing or range partitioning (start with fixed shards).
* **Placement**: each shard = Raft group; colocate multiple shards per process.
* **Router**: client or gateway routes requests to the correct group.
* **Rebalancing**: manual at first (admin API), then automated heuristic.
* **Deliverable**: multi-shard cluster where keys map to shard groups.
* **Tests**: hot-key distribution, shard movement, partial quorum scenarios.

---

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Operations & reliability (2‚Äì3 weeks)

* **Observability**:

  * Metrics: Raft health, quorum, commit lag, WAL bytes/sec, compaction, p99 lat/throughput.
  * Tracing across client ‚Üí router ‚Üí shard (OpenTelemetry).
  * Structured logs with correlation IDs.
* **Admin APIs**: membership change, take snapshot, transfer leadership.
* **Backups & restore**:

  * Online snapshot + SSTable copy + Raft snapshot index.
  * Consistent cluster-wide marker (pause applies or use sequence barriers).
* **Deliverable**: dashboards/alerts; SLOs (e.g., p99 write < 50ms at 5000 ops/sec).
* **Tests**: rolling restarts, snapshot/restore in staging, large compaction storms.

---

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Read scaling & secondary concerns (2‚Äì3 weeks)

* **Follower reads** (stale or with lease), optional **read-repair**.
* **Rate limiting & quotas** per tenant/keyspace.
* **Security**: mTLS between nodes and clients; authn tokens; basic ACLs.
* **Deliverable**: secure cluster with read-scaling toggles.
* **Tests**: cert rotation, token expiry, ACL enforcement under load.

---

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Hardening & correctness (ongoing)

* **Jepsen-style correctness** (bank transfer or compare-and-set model).
* **Fuzzing** RPC & Raft message streams.
* **Chaos**: packet loss, partitions, clock skews, disk full, slow fsync, corrupted SST.
* **Upgrades**: binary compatibility (proto versions), rolling deploys, schema changes for metadata.
* **Disaster Recovery**: region-level backups; RPO/RTO drills.

---

## Minimal external interface (first cut)

* **KV API**: `Get(key) -> value/NotFound`, `Put(key,value)`, `Delete(key)`, `CAS(key, expected, new)`.
* **Scan**: `Scan(prefix or [start,end), limit)`.
* **Consistency flags**: `READ_STRICT` (linearizable), `READ_LEASED`, `READ_FOLLOWER`.
* **Admin**: `AddNode`, `RemoveNode`, `TransferLeader`, `CreateShard`, `MoveShard`, `Snapshot`, `Backup`.

---

## Production checklists

### Availability & safety

* Majority quorum required for writes.
* At-most-once apply (dedupe by client id + sequence).
* Idempotent snapshot install.
* Bounded log growth (snapshots + compaction policy).

### Performance

* Batched appends, pipeline replication.
* Adaptive timeouts; exponential backoff.
* Flow control to slow followers; per-shard throughput accounting.

### Ops

* SLOs defined; alerts: election churn, commit lag, disk headroom, compaction backlog.
* Tunable compaction, rate limits, write buffer sizes.
* Tooling: hot shard detector, leader relocation.

---

## Suggested concrete tech (C/C++)

* **Storage**: RocksDB (or your LSM).
* **Consensus**: your own Raft or an embeddable lib (if policy allows).
* **RPC**: gRPC + Protobuf.
* **Metrics**: Prometheus C++ client.
* **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry C++ SDK.
* **Service mesh / TLS**: mTLS directly in gRPC, or run behind Envoy.
* **Deploy**: containers + Kubernetes (StatefulSets, PodDisruptionBudget, anti-affinity).
* **Bench**: YCSB; add custom microbench for p99 end-to-end.

---

## Stretch goals (after MVP)

* **Geo-replication**: async followers in other regions; RPO>0, tunable read staleness.
* **Change Data Capture**: streaming WAL to Kafka for downstream.
* **Compaction filters**: TTLs, tombstone GC.
* **Secondary indexes**: maintained via background jobs & two-phase upserts.
* **Lightweight transactions**: per-key linearizable CAS already there; add same-shard multi-op tx.

# Objective-C Mastery: Production-Grade iOS Development

> A comprehensive Objective-C curriculum designed for SDE-2 iOS engineers working with top-tier product companies (Apple, Spotify, Twitch, Google, Bloomberg, PayPal, Stripe, Uber).

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Production-grade Objective-C for modern iOS apps
- Interop with Swift and mixed-codebases at scale
- Mastery of runtime, memory, performance, and tooling
- Patterns and architectures used by top-tier companies

## ðŸ“š Structure

- `01-fundamentals/` â€” syntax, types, messaging, memory (ARC/MRR), blocks
- `02-advanced/` â€” runtime, swizzling, KVC/KVO, categories, protocols, GCD/NSOperation
- `03-patterns/` â€” MVC/MVVM, Coordinator, Repository, DI, Observer
- `04-frameworks/` â€” UIKit, Foundation, Core Data, Networking, Swift bridging
- `05-performance/` â€” Instruments, memory/CPU/UI optimization, autorelease pools
- `06-testing/` â€” XCTest (ObjC), OCMock, snapshot/UI tests
- `07-production/` â€” CI/CD, code quality, monitoring, observability, security
- `08-examples/` â€” real-world examples (UIKit apps, runtime features, bridging)
- `09-references/` â€” official docs, guides, community resources

## ðŸ§± Environment

- Xcode 15+
- iOS 15+ target
- Mixed Swift/ObjC bridging examples included

## âœ… Standards

- Apple API Design Guidelines (adapted)
- Robust error handling (where applicable)
- Clear comments and production-grade code
- Performance, security, and accessibility considered throughout

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Open `01-fundamentals/README.md` and begin with language essentials
2. Explore `02-advanced/` for runtime and concurrency
3. Study `03-patterns/` to build scalable architectures
4. Use `04-frameworks/` for framework and bridging patterns
5. Optimize with `05-performance/` and verify with `06-testing/`
6. Ensure production standards via `07-production/`

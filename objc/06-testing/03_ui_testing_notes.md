# UI Testing Notes (Objective-C with XCUITest)

- Create a UI Testing target; tests are in Swift/ObjC mix acceptable
- Use accessibility identifiers on views for robust selectors
- Launch arguments/environment to configure app state for tests
- Synchronization via expectations; avoid sleeps
- Capture screenshots on failure for diagnostics

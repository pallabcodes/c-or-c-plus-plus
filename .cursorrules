Repository wide standards for production grade code

Scope
* Applies to all languages and directories in this repository
* Complements language specific rules placed in subdirectories

General directives
* No hyphens anywhere in code or comments unless explicitly requested
* No emojis anywhere in code or comments unless explicitly requested
* Preserve existing indentation characters and width
* Keep code readable and maintainable with meaningful names
* Prefer early returns and shallow nesting
* Avoid unnecessary try catch blocks and avoid catching without meaningful handling

Documentation
* Provide concise comments only where critical for understanding intent or non obvious rationale
* All public APIs must have documentation comments appropriate for the language
* Keep README files current and actionable for each module

Error handling
* Validate inputs and fail fast with clear messages
* Avoid leaking internal details in error messages
* Use structured logging with correlation where applicable

Performance
* Write efficient code with attention to memory and allocation behavior
* Prefer immutable data where possible
* Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths
* Profile critical paths and record findings in module READMEs when relevant

Security
* Never commit secrets
* Validate and sanitize all external inputs
* Follow least privilege for resources and configuration

Testing
* Add unit tests for critical logic
* Add integration tests for cross module behavior when feasible
* Prefer deterministic tests and avoid reliance on real time or external state

Code review expectations
* Assume line by line scrutiny by principal level reviewers
* Favor clarity over cleverness
* Document tradeoffs and rationale for non trivial decisions

Language specific references
* dotnet rules live in dotnet directory specific files
* C and C plus plus rules are enforced by existing style in this repository

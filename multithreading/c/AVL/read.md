balance factor = height of left subtree - height of right subtree

bf = hl - hr (so this balance factor will be calculated per node of a binary search tree and it is known as AVL tree)

# once again bf will be calculated on every node, and bf will be either 0, -1 or 1

- if bf for any node greater less than or equal to 1, then that node is `balance`

- if bf for any node greater than 1, then that node is `imbalance`

- If any of the node is `imbalanced` then whole tree is `imbalanced`

1. Create a video diary which can serve as a reminder in my own understanding (without any fancy or complicated jargon)
2. Build in Public (through YouTube) + make my skills stronger

keyword:

clear concept, concept.dev, conceptualized, Koncept, concept builder, concept.build, Koncept.build etc.


- name: channel name should be when searched it should be first one


# Build in Public (through YouTube) + make my concepts solid on any tech that I work stronger through video diary i.e. youtube videos +


- Explaining the difficult concepts similar to Core Dumped YouTube channel: Main purpose to create my own video diary in my own understanding

- Actually code a minimalistic credible version low level stuff e.g. making a mini game with c# (not like creating a browser)

- Gathering not so common knowledge or deeper knowledge from books/article and make a video on my own understanding e.g. Kikis Bytes

- making videos about linux stuff that I actually use and implemented e.g. typecraft, linux tech tips

- Live coding scalable backend stuff e.g. piyush garg, lovepreet singh

- Actually coding low level system programming stuff e.g. Tsoding daily

- Building something and using shell scripting to solve a problem


# Everybody knows Array, but does most of them even know how Array works, how memory allocated, where array shines and fails, how it literally stores data and such e.g. https://www.youtube.com/@nicbarkeragain/videos

# There are loads of videos who has DSA tutorials but how many actually explain in freaking the core concept first and foremost of any Data Structure before jumping into problem solving e.g. LinkedList (what , why and what are its key abilities and what its real use cases) -> foundational problems solving -> then solve whatever questions viewer wants


Exploring the backend of a product I like or products of the company that I wanna apply: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGD1rrMSuzo but then again to find info related to directly or indirectly: blogs/articles + youtube + books + 

e.g. A Big tech company uses this tech but how off course not revealed outside so I know the tech and the service the offers, based on that I can deduce and build something minimal using that tech (my logic with the tech could be way off the mark and that's fine it just have to related to that service/company using the very tech or tech stack)




# Plan for content

- Pick a domain e.g. Gihub topics / Play Store / App Store / Twitter and find the Open source repos or public repos and EXTRACT / LEARN from it and APPLY

- Actual Approach


- Let's say I am standing at a step where I have an input of integer array , now at this moment what (actions) can I do to an array ?

-> ACTION FIRST THEN STORAGE

1. sort
2. search
3. rotate
4. divide
5. save partially or fully into another ds
6. create copy (fully or partially) into same or different ds
7. save its reference or pointer so to say
8. Transform it value and store into same or another ds

-> STORAGE FIRST THEN ACTION(S)

1. Take the current input and create a copy (fully or partially) into same or different ds
2. Take the current input and store into same or different DS (AS IT IS / PARTIAL (with or without modification), SPECIFIC (with or without modification) /  What is missing here ? c)
3. create a different data set / keys that links / refers to current input or such
3. create a different data set / keys that links / refers to current input or such


so , what I want you to do complete the list and no matter which data structure is picked to solve a question, this will hold true

You're right to focus on projects that will make your portfolio stand out, especially when applying to top tech companies like Uber, Google, Amazon, and Indeed. The projects I suggested are indeed geared towards software engineering roles, but let's refine the list to ensure it's even more targeted and impressive for these specific companies.

Here's a revised list of projects, with explanations on why they're particularly relevant:

1. Distributed Real-time Analytics Engine
   - Relevance: Crucial for companies like Google (Analytics), Amazon (product analytics), Uber (ride data)
   - Key DSA: Streaming algorithms, probabilistic data structures (HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch)
   - Languages: Go or Rust

2. Scalable Message Queue System
   - Relevance: Core infrastructure at Amazon (AWS SQS), Uber (message passing between services)
   - Key DSA: Distributed hash tables, consistent hashing, log-structured storage
   - Languages: Go or Rust

3. Distributed Search Engine
   - Relevance: Core technology for Google, Amazon (product search), Indeed (job search)
   - Key DSA: Inverted index, TF-IDF, PageRank, distributed indexing
   - Languages: C++ or Rust

4. Real-time Recommendation System
   - Relevance: Critical for Amazon (product recommendations), Netflix (content suggestions)
   - Key DSA: Collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, item-item similarity graphs
   - Languages: C++ or Rust, with a JavaScript front-end

5. Distributed Task Scheduler and Workflow Engine
   - Relevance: Essential for Uber (trip assignment), Amazon (AWS Step Functions)
   - Key DSA: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), topological sorting, distributed consensus
   - Languages: Go

6. High-Performance Key-Value Store
   - Relevance: Fundamental for Amazon (DynamoDB), Google (Bigtable)
   - Key DSA: LSM trees, bloom filters, consistent hashing
   - Languages: C++ or Rust

7. Real-time Geospatial Index and Query Engine
   - Relevance: Critical for Uber (driver/rider matching), Google Maps
   - Key DSA: R-trees, Quadtrees, geohashing
   - Languages: Go or Rust

8. Distributed Rate Limiter
   - Relevance: Essential for API management at all major tech companies
   - Key DSA: Token bucket algorithm, sliding window counters, distributed counters
   - Languages: Go

9. Large-Scale Data Processing Pipeline
   - Relevance: Fundamental at Google (MapReduce), Amazon (EMR)
   - Key DSA: External sorting, partitioning strategies, distributed algorithms
   - Languages: Go or Rust

10. Fault-Tolerant Distributed Cache
    - Relevance: Critical infrastructure at Amazon, Google, Uber
    - Key DSA: Consistent hashing, gossip protocols, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
    - Languages: Go or Rust

These projects are particularly impressive because:

1. They solve real problems these companies face daily.
2. They demonstrate your ability to work with distributed systems, which is crucial for large-scale applications.
3. They showcase your skills in performance optimization and scalability.
4. They require deep understanding of complex data structures and algorithms.
5. They align with the tech stacks commonly used at these companies.

To make your portfolio truly stand out:

1. Implement these projects with production-quality code.
2. Write comprehensive documentation explaining your design decisions and trade-offs.
3. Include performance benchmarks and comparisons with existing solutions.
4. Add monitoring and observability features.
5. Consider open-sourcing your projects and getting community feedback.
6. Write blog posts or create videos explaining the challenges you faced and how you solved them.

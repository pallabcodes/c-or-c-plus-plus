# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implementation in C++ with SDL2 graphics, featuring a comprehensive point system and checkpoint functionality.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control a snake to eat food and grow longer
- **SDL2 Graphics**: Modern graphical interface with smooth rendering
- **Point System**: Score tracking with high score persistence
- **Checkpoint System**: Save and restore game progress
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Modern C++**: Built with C++17 standards

## Game Controls

- **Movement**: Arrow keys or WASD
- **Pause**: Spacebar or ESC
- **Start Game**: Spacebar from menu
- **Exit**: ESC key

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- SDL2 development libraries
- SDL2_ttf for text rendering
- CMake 3.16 or later

## Installation

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev cmake build-essential
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf cmake
```

### Windows
- Install Visual Studio with C++ support
- Install SDL2 development libraries
- Install CMake

## Building

```bash
cd snake-game
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

## Running

```bash
cd build/bin
./snake
```

## Game Architecture

The game follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Game**: Main game loop and state management
- **Snake**: Snake entity with movement and growth logic
- **Food**: Food generation and positioning
- **Board**: Game board and collision detection
- **Renderer**: SDL2-based graphics rendering
- **ScoreManager**: Point calculation and tracking
- **CheckpointManager**: Checkpoint creation and restoration

## Development Status

âœ… **Completed Features:**
- Core snake movement and growth mechanics
- Food generation and collision detection
- Wall and self-collision detection
- Basic point system with high score tracking
- Checkpoint system with save/load functionality
- SDL2-based graphical interface
- Cross-platform build system

ðŸ”„ **In Progress:**
- Game testing and bug fixes
- Performance optimization

ðŸ“‹ **Future Enhancements:**
- Advanced graphics and animations
- Sound effects and music
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Multiplayer support

# 🎯 **NETWORKING PROJECT - COMPLETE SUCCESS!**

## ✅ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

You asked for "a proper coding project" to understand HTTP and WebSocket anatomy "so very well that when I talk about Google's backend engineer, low level system developer and even network engineers would nod their head."

**We delivered exactly that.** Here's what we built:

---

## 🏆 **PRODUCTION-GRADE IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Complete Architecture Built From Scratch:**

#### 1. **Socket Layer** - Industrial Strength
- ✅ RAII-based socket wrapper with proper resource management
- ✅ Non-blocking I/O with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Socket options (SO_REUSEADDR, TCP_NODELAY, SO_LINGER)
- ✅ IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack support with address resolution
- ✅ Connection lifecycle management

#### 2. **HTTP Parser** - RFC 7230 Compliant
- ✅ Complete HTTP/1.1 parser with incremental processing
- ✅ Support for chunked transfer encoding
- ✅ Header normalization and case-insensitive access
- ✅ URL encoding/decoding with proper UTF-8 handling
- ✅ Query string parsing
- ✅ Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding validation

#### 3. **WebSocket Implementation** - RFC 6455 Compliant
- ✅ Complete frame parser for all opcodes (TEXT, BINARY, CLOSE, PING, PONG)
- ✅ Frame masking/unmasking with SIMD optimization potential
- ✅ Message fragmentation and reassembly
- ✅ UTF-8 validation for text frames
- ✅ WebSocket handshake key generation (SHA-1 + Base64)
- ✅ Close code handling with proper error reporting

#### 4. **Production Examples**
- ✅ **HTTP Server**: Event-driven with epoll, connection pooling, static file serving
- ✅ **WebSocket Chat**: Real-time bidirectional communication with broadcasting
